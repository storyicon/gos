Build compiles the packages named by the import paths,
along with their dependencies, but it does not install the results.

If the arguments to build are a list of .go files, build treats
them as a list of source files specifying a single package.

When compiling a single main package, build writes
the resulting executable to an output file named after
the first source file ('go build ed.go rx.go' writes 'ed' or 'ed.exe')
or the source code directory ('go build unix/sam' writes 'sam' or 'sam.exe').
The '.exe' suffix is added when writing a Windows executable.

When compiling multiple packages or a single non-main package,
build compiles the packages but discards the resulting object,
serving only as a check that the packages can be built.

When compiling packages, build ignores files that end in '_test.go'.

The -o flag, only allowed when compiling a single package,
forces build to write the resulting executable or object
to the named output file, instead of the default behavior described
in the last two paragraphs.

The -i flag installs the packages that are dependencies of the target.

The build flags are shared by the build, clean, get, install, list, run,
and test commands:

	-a
		force rebuilding of packages that are already up-to-date.
	-n
		print the commands but do not run them.
	-p n
		the number of programs, such as build commands or
		test binaries, that can be run in parallel.
		The default is the number of CPUs available.
	-race
		enable data race detection.
		Supported only on linux/amd64, freebsd/amd64, darwin/amd64 and windows/amd64.
	-msan
		enable interoperation with memory sanitizer.
		Supported only on linux/amd64, linux/arm64
		and only with Clang/LLVM as the host C compiler.
	-v
		print the names of packages as they are compiled.
	-work
		print the name of the temporary work directory and
		do not delete it when exiting.
	-x
		print the commands.

	-asmflags '[pattern=]arg list'
		arguments to pass on each go tool asm invocation.
	-buildmode mode
		build mode to use. See 'go help buildmode' for more.
	-compiler name
		name of compiler to use, as in runtime.Compiler (gccgo or gc).
	-gccgoflags '[pattern=]arg list'
		arguments to pass on each gccgo compiler/linker invocation.
	-gcflags '[pattern=]arg list'
		arguments to pass on each go tool compile invocation.
	-installsuffix suffix
		a suffix to use in the name of the package installation directory,
		in order to keep output separate from default builds.
		If using the -race flag, the install suffix is automatically set to race
		or, if set explicitly, has _race appended to it. Likewise for the -msan
		flag. Using a -buildmode option that requires non-default compile flags
		has a similar effect.
	-ldflags '[pattern=]arg list'
		arguments to pass on each go tool link invocation.
	-linkshared
		link against shared libraries previously created with
		-buildmode=shared.
	-mod mode
		module download mode to use: readonly or vendor.
		See 'go help modules' for more.
	-pkgdir dir
		install and load all packages from dir instead of the usual locations.
		For example, when building with a non-standard configuration,
		use -pkgdir to keep generated packages in a separate location.
	-tags 'tag list'
		a space-separated list of build tags to consider satisfied during the
		build. For more information about build tags, see the description of
		build constraints in the documentation for the go/build package.
	-toolexec 'cmd args'
		a program to use to invoke toolchain programs like vet and asm.
		For example, instead of running asm, the go command will run
		'cmd args /path/to/asm <arguments for asm>'.

The -asmflags, -gccgoflags, -gcflags, and -ldflags flags accept a
space-separated list of arguments to pass to an underlying tool
during the build. To embed spaces in an element in the list, surround
it with either single or double quotes. The argument list may be
preceded by a package pattern and an equal sign, which restricts
the use of that argument list to the building of packages matching
that pattern (see 'go help packages' for a description of package
patterns). Without a pattern, the argument list applies only to the
packages named on the command line. The flags may be repeated
with different patterns in order to specify different arguments for
different sets of packages. If a package matches patterns given in
multiple flags, the latest match on the command line wins.
For example, 'go build -gcflags=-S fmt' prints the disassembly
only for package fmt, while 'go build -gcflags=all=-S fmt'
prints the disassembly for fmt and all its dependencies.

For more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.
For more about where packages and binaries are installed,
run 'go help gopath'.
For more about calling between Go and C/C++, run 'go help c'.

Note: Build adheres to certain conventions such as those described
by 'go help gopath'. Not all projects can follow these conventions,
however. Installations that have their own conventions or that use
a separate software build system may choose to use lower-level
invocations such as 'go tool compile' and 'go tool link' to avoid
some of the overheads and design decisions of the build tool.
